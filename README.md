# Rise Together

## Objective
An app that connects alumni of the RISE program together. Users should be able to share job and housing opportunities, view a calendar of RISE-related events, and share their own life events in a social-media-esque feed.

## Current Features Implemented
We have successfully developed the following capabilities in this app:

- A tabbed view that navigates between view controllers
- A calendar that changes accordingly with each month
- Custom table cells that show housing, job, and feed information
- The ability to add new custom cells to the housing, feed, and job tables
- An image picker class that allows users to upload images to these cells

## Features In Progress
The following are features that are still being developed:

- Implementing signup/login functionality
- Storing data on a database and displaying it to multiple devices
- Adding events to the calendar
- Changing basic profile information
